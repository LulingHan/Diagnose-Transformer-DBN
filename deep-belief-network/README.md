# deep-belief-network
A simple, clean, fast Python implementation of Deep Belief Networks based on binary Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), built upon NumPy and TensorFlow libraries in order to take advantage of GPU computation:

## Usage
This implementation follows [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) guidelines and in turn, can be used alongside it. Next you have a demo code for solving digits classification problem which can be found in **classification_demo.py** (check **regression_demo.py** for a regression problem and **unsupervised_demo.py** for an unsupervised feature learning problem).

Code can run either in GPU or CPU. To decide where the computations have to be performed is as easy as importing the classes from the correct module: if they are imported from _dbn.tensorflow_ computations will be carried out on GPU (or CPU depending on your hardware) using TensorFlow, if imported from _dbn_ computations will be done on CPU using NumPy. **~~Note only pre-training step is GPU accelerated so far~~ Both pre-training and fine-tuning steps are GPU accelarated**. Look the following snippet:

    import numpy as np

    np.random.seed(1337)  # for reproducibility
    from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics.classification import accuracy_score

    from dbn.tensorflow import SupervisedDBNClassification
    # use "from dbn import SupervisedDBNClassification" for computations on CPU with numpy

    # Loading dataset
    digits = load_digits()
    X, Y = digits.data, digits.target

    # Data scaling
    X = (X / 16).astype(np.float32)

    # Splitting data
    X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

    # Training
    classifier = SupervisedDBNClassification(hidden_layers_structure=[256, 256],
                                             learning_rate_rbm=0.05,
                                             learning_rate=0.1,
                                             n_epochs_rbm=10,
                                             n_iter_backprop=100,
                                             batch_size=32,
                                             activation_function='relu',
                                             dropout_p=0.2)
    classifier.fit(X_train, Y_train)

    # Save the model
    classifier.save('model.pkl')

    # Restore it
    classifier = SupervisedDBNClassification.load('model.pkl')

    # Test
    Y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
    print('Done.\nAccuracy: %f' % accuracy_score(Y_test, Y_pred))

## Installation
I strongly recommend to use a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) in order not to break anything of your current enviroment.

Open a terminal and type the following line, it will install the package using pip:

        pip install git+git://github.com/albertbup/deep-belief-network.git
